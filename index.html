					Chicken
				</div>
				<p>
				An ultra chicken sandwich served on a sesame bun topped with banana slices and orange peels. A true delicacy amongst city dwellers. None can argue that is has a superior taste above all other chicken. We feed our chicken only with the finest non-gmo grains and pure spring water.

					Beef
				</div>
				<p>
				Are you hungry? Well you won't be for long if you order our beef! Not only does it come from grass fed cows, but we have several 3rd party auditors constantly roaming our farms. In fact I would compare them to cockroaches. We can't even take a paid 15 minute break without the auditors hovering over us.

					Falafel
				</div>
				<p>
				Now is the time to enjoy our purest version of a classic middle eastern dish. Falafels! We've fried them to perfection using an age old family secret. We serve them within delicious pita bread complete with garlic paste, lettuce, tomatoes, and a soft drink on the side.
